# Mouse_Maze
---
Graphical maze-solving application where users can interactively create a maze and visualize a pathfinding algorithm in SFML, built using C++

This was made primarily as an experiment with visualizing algorithms and using BFS in C++

## The main idea is that you are able to place a start and end point

## Then draw a maze to find the shortest path through

## The BFS traversal will then 'sniff' out the end point

## And return the shortest path (in terms of steps, there is no path costs)
